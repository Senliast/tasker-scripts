# DisablePermissionsAutoRevoke![Android 11 automatic permissions revoke](https://github.com/Senliast/tasker-scripts/blob/main/DisablePermissionsAutoRevoke/docs/android-11-automatic-permissions-revoke.jpg)## AboutGoogle introduced a new auto-reset permissions feature with Android 11 to automatically revoke sensitive runtime permissions from apps that have not been in use for a few months. You can disable it, but you have to do it for every app separately. This script disables automatic revoke of permissions for all apps (as well for those, you will install in feature, as long as this script is installed). Do note: this script is dependent on the shell script of the same name. Do note: this script needs root privileges. Please dont use it if you have Android 10 or lower, because it uses another mechanism for permissions revoke! This script is suitable for Tasker.The default directory to put the script files to is "/sdcard/.ServiceData" but you can place it into other directory if you want. Please note, that name and path to the directory must include only english letters and be without spaces.## DownloadYou can download latest release from: https://github.com/Senliast/tasker-scripts/releases/tag/DisablePermissionsAutoRevoke-v1.0 (please download zip-file).## Installation1. Place the shell script (the file itself, without folder) into the default folder "sdcard/.ServiceData" or into other, if you want.2. Import files from the "tasks" folder as tasks in Tasker (tap on "tasks" tab and select "import a task").3. Import files from the "profiles" folder as profiles in Tasker (tap on "profiles" tab and select "import a profile").4. You need this step only if you placed the files into other directory then default: - open the task "AllowApkInstallationFromAllApps.Variables" and set the variable "DisablePermissionsAutoRevokeScriptDir" to the directory, where you placed the file.5. Reboot the device or completely stop (disable) Tasker and then start it again.## Uninstalling1. Remove all profiles that start with "DisablePermissionsAutoRevoke" in Tasker.2. Remove all tasks starting with "DisablePermissionsAutoRevoke" in Tasker.3. Remove all files from the script.
