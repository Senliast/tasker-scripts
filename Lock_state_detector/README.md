# LockStateDetector
## About
This script detects whether the device is unlocked or locked and stores the result in the %Locked variable. The value of the variable %Locked indicates the state (true=locked, false=unlocked) and is always up-to-date (update interval - 1 second), i.e. the variable can be at most 1 second old. The reason for this is that Android does not send an intent when locking. This script does not do anything by its own.
