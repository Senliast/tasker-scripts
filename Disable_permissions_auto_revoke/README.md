# Disable permissions auto revoke![Android 11 automatic permissions revoke](https://github.com/Senliast/tasker-scripts/blob/main/Disable_permissions_auto_revoke/docs/android-11-automatic-permissions-revoke.jpg)## AboutGoogle introduced a new auto-reset permissions feature with Android 11 to automatically revoke sensitive runtime permissions from apps that have not been in use for a few months. You can disable it, but you have to do it for every app separately. This Tasker script disables automatic revoke of permissions for all apps (as well for those, you will install in feature, as long as this script is installed). Do note: this script needs root privileges. Please dont use it if you have Android 10 or lower, because it uses another mechanism for permissions revoke!The default directory to put the script files to is "/sdcard/Software_support/Service_data/" but you can place it into other directory if you want. Please note, that name and path to the directory must include only english letters and be without spaces.## DownloadYou can download latest release from: https://github.com/Senliast/tasker-scripts/releases/tag/Disable-permissions-auto-revoke-v1.0.## Installation1.
